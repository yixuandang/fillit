# Fillit _ Can You Feel it?

The second project when I was in University 42

Group project with Aaron_Jude@42

#### There are some much faster version of it, you can check it online.

After finishing [libft@42](https://github.com/yixuandang/libft).We can use the function we rewritten in libft in this project(fillit).

The purpose of this project is to make the smallest possible "square"(which can contain holes) with a given list of tetriminos, but the disposition must be as such that it returns the first possible solution when placing them recursively from top left.

### Compiling
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Run `make`, an executable called `fillit` should compile directly. Please submit an issue if you run into any.

### Usage

`./fillit [file]`
